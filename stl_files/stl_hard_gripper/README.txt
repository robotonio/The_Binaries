# Summary

I needed a gripper for the robot i'm building with my son, and found the Solid MeArm gripper to be quite nice and functional, with a low count of additional screws. It had the drawback of being too thick, and didn't have the right mount for my bot, so i remodeled some parts using OnShape to be more precise and also because i like to use parametric cads to adjust things quickly. I did not remodel the arms as they only needed a thickness change, i did that using blender. Also i changed the design for the servo spacer to made it thicker and attach it to the rear screws, since the small 2mm screws that i have for the servo are not long enough to reach the top plate.

# Post-Printing

The only thing that needed some additional filing were the bushings: despite the fact that i made them thinner than the arm hole, they still needed some fixes after print because they did not slide in smoothly.
