# The_Binaries
This is the research project of "The Binaries" team, in the FLL "INTO ORBIT" competition, in 2019. The project's object is the exploitation of "Soft Robotics" technology in space and for this purpose, the team has developed a system which compares the pros and cons of soft &amp; hard grippers.

The name of the S/H system comes from the words Soft vs. Hard (actuators).
The main purpose of the system is to show some of the advantages of Soft Robotics in the field of actuators. The above objective should not be construed as an attempt to prove that soft actuators are "better" than traditional actuators (hard), as Soft Robotics can not substitute current technology but can help address specific problems. The system is controlled by a central console, as well as remote control (Bluetooth) via an Android application developed for that purpose.
